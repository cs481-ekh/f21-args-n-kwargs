## Project Abstract 
In an attempt to share university-owened equipment for making, processing, and characterizing materials with a wider community, many faculty member have been trying to establish and maintain a central repository to organize this information. Currently, a group attempts to catalog the information from various BSU departments so that it is organgized for distrubtion.
