## Project Abstract 
In an attempt to share university-owned equipment for making, processing, and characterizing materials with a wider community, many faculty member have been trying to establish and maintain a central repository to organize this information. Currently, a group attempts to catalog the information from various BSU departments so that it is organized for distribution. The information is then manually entered into a spreadsheet and shared other via a URL. This is a very time consuming and erroneous process of maintaining and disturbing this information. The proposal was to create a database with a web interface that can be used to manage and access the data.

We have built a web application that is hosted on BSU intranet that allows faculty and students to a place to manage and organize university-owned equipment. This application allows users to create, edit, update, and delete equipment items from a database. This improves the integrity of the data entered by validating the various form fields characterizing a piece of equipment. Furthermore, it enables a user to upload csv files to import data in a time efficient manner. This web application can be easily shared with a wider community via URL. This user-friendly application will greatly improve the experience in organizing the equipment owned by the University.
